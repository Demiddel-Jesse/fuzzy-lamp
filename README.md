# fuzzy-lamp
Python file meant to read specific data from a bunch of files
Written to read genome types from a specific set of genome rs-numbers

## !ATTENTION!
When entering the column numbers for the position of the name and type do not enter them as an array value (eg. Start counting from 0) instead as a normal number (eg. Start counting from 1). Otherwise you will get errors as the wrong data will be read or you will get an out of array error
